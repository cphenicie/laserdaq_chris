Instructions for setting up the Toptica laser to take data with it:

TL;DR

1) Connect the laser to the computer using an ethernet cable
2) Connect NI USB6002 port PFI1 to the BNC labelled "2" coming out of the Toptica
3) Connect the data you want into the analog input ports of the NI USB6002 (for instance, GasCell into AI0 and
   Interferometer into AI1)
4) Run ScanController.py with the correct inputs to collect your data

LONG EXPLANATION HERE
The GUI (ScanUI.ui) was written in Qt Designer,
A simple example of GUI programming is given in ????

It's non-trivial to use matplotlib graphs with Qt, it requires a QWidget to be used as a placeholder and the use of the
obscure matplotlib libraries imported in ScanController.txt

We use threading to allow the GUI to simultaneously take data, plot data, and still be responsive. A simple example of
using threading is shown in SimpleThreadExample.py
