# A collection of functions to communicate with the Toptica laser. This is accomplished through a telnet connection, for
# instance, through an ethernet cable between the DAQ computer and the laser

######## Contents ########

### Functions ###
# setScan: Given a telnet connection to the laser, set up a scan that runs between two wavelengths at a specified speed
# waitForSlew: function runs until the laser is at a specified wavelength, then it returns nothing
# saveData: Save the data from a scan
